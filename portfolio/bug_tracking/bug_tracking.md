# Bug Tracking Process

## Overview

This document outlines the process of tracking and fixing a bug in our Python code using GitHub.

## Steps Taken

1. **Add a Bug in Python Code**:
   - Introduced a bug in the `add_numbers` function in `main.py` by changing addition to subtraction.

2. **Create a Branch**:
   - Created a new branch `fix-bug` to work on the bug fix.

3. **Fix the Bug**:
   - Corrected the `add_numbers` function to perform addition instead of subtraction.

4. **Merge the Branch**:
   - Merged the `fix-bug` branch into the `main` branch.

5. **Track the Bug with GitHub Issues**:
   - Created a GitHub Issue describing the bug.
   - Linked the issue to the commits by referencing it in the commit messages.
   - Closed the issue either automatically or manually.

## Issue Tracking

- **Issue Created**: [Bug in Addition Function](https://github.com/monikaIBA/Portfolio/issues/1)
- **Issue Closed**: The issue was closed after merging the fix.
